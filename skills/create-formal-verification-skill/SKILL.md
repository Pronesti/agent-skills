name: create-formal-verification-skill
description: Generate a project-local skill that formally verifies the code where a bug costs the most and tests reach the least, in any language, with whichever verification tool fits. Use for /create-formal-verification-skill, "model-check this race", "prove this invariant", or when concurrency, retries, state machines, parsers, or unsafe code need more than tests.

Use only when explicitly selected. Apply this workflow to the authorized task.
Resolve this entrypoint's symlink to its canonical directory before following relative paths.

1. In Codex, read [the Codex harness adapter](../../pstack/docs/harness/codex.md).
   In Claude Code, read [the Claude harness adapter](../../pstack/docs/harness/claude-code.md).
   In Cursor, use the upstream tool names. Apply the repository's invocation policy in every host.
2. Read [the complete upstream workflow](../../pstack/skills/create-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md),
   then follow it using that adapter. Resolve its references relative to the upstream file.

The adapter applies to the workflow and all resources it reaches. A selected workflow
may read its declared supporting resources within scope; naming another workflow
does not independently authorize additional work, external actions, or a session-wide mode.
